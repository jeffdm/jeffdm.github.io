Here you can change environment variables for your app. Your app may come with
some default variables:

**APP_ID** - unique ID for your app

**SSH_KEY** - your public key for SSH into your app

**VIRTUAL_HOST** - URL of the app on your computer

**VIRTUAL_PORT** - the port which the app is running within the container
