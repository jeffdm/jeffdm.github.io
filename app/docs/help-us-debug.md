## Help Us Debug

---

Kitematic is still in its early stage. We're working hard on ironing out the kinks and make Kitematic a great experience.

If you found any issues with Kitematic, you can send us the console logs to really help us speed up the fixes.

You can start Kitematic with console logs with the following steps:

{% highlight bash %}
cd <dir with Kitematic.app>
./Kitematic.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom
{% endhighlight %}

Feel free to hop in our [support chat](https://www.hipchat.com/giAT9Fqb5) to tell us more about the issues as well.
