## Help Us Debug

---

You can start Kitematic with console logs with the following steps:

{% highlight bash %}
cd <dir with Kitematic.app>
./Kitematic.app/Contents/MacOS/Atom
{% endhighlight %}

If you find any issues with Kitematic, you can send us the console logs to really help us speed up the fixes.

Feel free to hop in our [support chat](https://www.hipchat.com/giAT9Fqb5) to tell us more about the issues as well.
