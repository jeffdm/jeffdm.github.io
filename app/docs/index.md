## Install Kitematic

---

### Download Kitematic

[Download Kitematic](/download), unzip it and double-click the application to run it.

### Initial Setup

Opening Kitematic for the first time will take a bit longer than usual. If required, Kitematic will download and install VirtualBox. Older versions of VirtualBox will be updated.

Kitematic will then set up a Linux VM in which to build images and run Docker containers.

Once the setup's done you should be greeted with a blank images screen:
