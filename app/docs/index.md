## Getting Started

---

### Download & Install Kite

Download the Kite Mac App and double-click to install it.

### Create Application

After Kite is installed, you'll see the screen below. Click on the **Create App**
button to start creating an application.

Once you click the button, you'll see the create app dialog. You can now give your app a name and
pick the type of app from a list of images. If you are just starting, there'll
be no images and you'll have to create one first. Click on the green **Create Image**
button to start creating an image.

### Create Image

To create an image, simply pick any folder on your computer with a Dockerfile
in it to start the Docker build process. If you don't have a folder right now
with Dockerfile right now, you can download an example HTML app [here](https://github.com/usekite/html/archive/master.zip).

Building the image might take a couple minutes, because Docker need to pull the
base images such as Ubuntu required to build the image. After the image is built,
you can click on the **plus** icon to create an app from this image.

running on your computer.

the app stores its code.
