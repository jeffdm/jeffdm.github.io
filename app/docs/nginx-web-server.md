## Serving a Static Website with Nginx

---

In this tutorial, you will:

- Download and run a web server container
- Explore the container's website data natively on your Mac
- Use volumes to modify the website data

In this example website we'll be serving the popular 2048 game, as shown below. Let's get to it!

#### Running the Nginx Web Server Container

First, [download and start Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/download) if you haven't yet done so. Once you're in, the app should look like this:

Click on the _Create_ button of the `hello-world-nginx` listing as shown above. This will download and run a tiny Nginx web server in a container via Kitematic, allowing you serve website data on your Mac.

Once it's done downloading you should see a quick preview of the example website that comes with the container, as shown below. Click on the preview to see the result in your own browser.

**What just happened?** Kitematic downloaded the `kitematic/hello-world-nginx` image from the Docker Hub and then created and ran a Docker Nginx container from this image.

#### Viewing the Website Data in Finder

This container exposes website data via a _Docker volume_. Kitematic makes managing Docker volumes easy - you can edit the data in Finder or with your favorite text editor. By default, Kitematic places volumes under `~/Kitematic` but you can change this in the container settings. To access the files via finder, click on the in-app folder icon for a container:

A Finder directory should open containing the index.html file we see being served by the container.

#### Serving Your Own Website Data

Let's serve a more interesting website! [Download the files](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/archive/master.zip) for 2048, a popular (and addicting) web-based game. Extract this zip file into the folder we just opened:

Switch back to Kitematic and restart the container as shown below. Your Nginx container should now serving 2048! Awesome!

**What just happened?**
Kitematic automatically exposes Docker container volumes via directories on your Mac. In this case we changed the container's volume data to serve a website we downloaded.
