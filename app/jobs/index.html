          <h3>Our Team</h3>
          <p>
            Kitematic (acquired by Docker in 2015) is a Mac app for managing
            Docker containers. It brings a visual interface to the Docker
            platform, making it even more powerful and easy to use. We're
            looking for an experienced software engineer to join the team.
            In this role, you'll leverage core pieces of the Docker platform
            to architect and build an intuitive product for developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our team is highly autonomous. We love making developers' lives
            easier and every member is directly responsible for the product's
            success. Kitematic is open source and part of Docker, one of the
            fastest-growing open source communities in the world.
